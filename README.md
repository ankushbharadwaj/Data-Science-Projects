Collection of data science projects, ranging between personal and educational and research!

[Iris Species Prediction](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Iris%20Species%20Prediction): Tested the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in predicting the exact species of *Iris* flower based off *Iris* flower data set collected by Edgar Anderson to study the morphologic variation within closely related species of *Iris* flowers. Upon deciding to use the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for its accuracy and simplicity, tested the accuracy of my model on the validation set and quantified the model's accuracy for predicting the species of *Iris* based on sepal and petal measurements to be 90%.

[Loan Prediction](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Loan%20Prediction): Automated processes of a theoretical home loan company by predicting whether or not an individual's loan would be approved by using classification algorithms. Finally settled on using the Random forest algorithm with the predictor variables as follows: Total Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Dependents, and Property Area. My model, using a Random Forest algorithm, yielded an accuracy of 82.736% and a cross-validation score of 80.297%.
