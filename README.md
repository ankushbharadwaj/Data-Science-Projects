[Iris Species Prediction](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Iris%20Species%20Prediction): Tested the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in predicting the exact species of *Iris* flower based off *Iris* flower data set collected by Edgar Anderson to study the morphologic variation within closely related species of *Iris* flowers. Upon deciding to use the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for its accuracy and simplicity, tested the accuracy of my model on the validation set and quantified the model's accuracy for predicting the species of *Iris* based on sepal and petal measurements to be 90%.
