In this project, the following attributes of a cryptocurrency are given: 
- number of trades = 402
- open = .049867
- high = .132756
- low = .4223598
- volume = 180465.4463
Over the course of the project, I predicted the closing value to be 0.7715777190662515. Owing to the fact that the predicted closing value is greater than the opening value, I recommended this cryptocurrency should be sold, as the value of the cryptocurrency is projected to increase as the day continues.
